# Sales Enablement Materials

We want to make it easier for you to introduce and implement CIPP within your business. To support that, we’ve created a set of **free Sales Enablement Materials** that are available to everyone—whether you’re a CIPP user or not.

We strongly believe in raising the bar across the entire IT and MSP community. That means **no paywalls, no gated forms, and no hidden sales traps**. You don’t have to give us your email address or end up in a never-ending sales cycle. Just open the materials and start using them.

## How to Use These Materials

Each resource is built as a **template** that you can adapt to your own organization. We’ve included examples and suggested language to help you get started, but you’re encouraged to adjust the tone, style, and messaging so it fits your brand and customer voice. The templates are completely adaptable to your brand, feel free to do so.

Think of the templates as jumping off points. Use them to:

* Train your sales team with ready-made collateral.
* Adapt content for customer-facing proposals, presentations, and onboarding.
* Save time by customizing proven structures rather than starting from scratch.

The guide has several implementation strategies available, including to assist you in upselling clients to M365 Business Premium if required, as MSPs its often difficult to handle objections clients can throw up.

This helps you use all the features in M365, and implementing more security for all your clients.
