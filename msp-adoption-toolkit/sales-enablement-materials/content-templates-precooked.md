# Content Templates - Precooked

CyberDrain wants to make sure we give you resources that you can actually use. It's hard and takes time to create marketing materials that stand out enough, and are still usable as a template. We also understand that most MSPs don't have the resources or marketing departments available to create this content for them.&#x20;

To use the LinkedIn Slideshow posts we recommend changing the colours and logo, and name to your own MSP. This is best done by editing the Master Slide.

* Go to the **View** tab in PowerPoint, and click **Slide Master**
* In the **Master Slide (top-most slide)**, go to **Insert → Pictures**.
* Select your company logo and place it in one of the "Logo Spaces". These use safe margins to make sure you logo is in the correct place.
* Resize as needed. This ensures the logo appears on every slide automatically.
* Still in **Slide Master**, select **Colors → Customize Colors** (found under the **Slide Master → Edit Theme** group).
* Replace the default accent colors with your MSP’s brand palette (primary, secondary, neutral tones).
* Save this template, when you paste the content from our precooked templates it will automatically follow your own branding.
