# Troubleshooting Instructions

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**You must always supply all information requested in this document.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

To ensure we can assist you with any CIPP issue, complete details are essential. This includes all three mandatory screenshots: Permissions Check, GDAP Check, and Tenant Access Check. Without these, we cannot offer support, as they are the foundation for understanding and resolving your issue.

## **1. Perform Permissions Check**

* **How to**: Navigate to CIPP -> Application Settings, and select "Permissions".
* Click on "Refesh"&#x20;
* **What to Share**: A screenshot of the page, and an Export of the report by pressing the Export button.

## **2. Conduct GDAP Check**

* **After successfully completing Permissions Check**, also refresh the GDAP check
* **What to Share**: A screenshot of the GDAP information.



***

## **If Errors Persist After Checks:**

* **Capture Additional Screenshots**: If checks complete but you're still facing issues, please include a screenshot of the entire page where the error occurs.
* **Error Details**: If an error pop-up appears, include its screenshot or text. This helps us diagnose the problem more accurately.

**Important**: Even if the error appears on only one page, all checks (Permissions, GDAP, and Tenant Access) are always required for us to provide support.

**Privacy Note**: Anonymize any sensitive data in your screenshots before sharing them on our discord community if you are planning to do so.

## **Examples for Effective Communication:**

* **Good Troubleshooting Message**:
  * _Example:_ "I've been getting the error "User not found" on all pages related to exchange. I have executed all checks and the screenshots are included. I can see the GDAP checks are failing but I'm not sure on my next steps. How do I continue?"
  * _Includes_: All three check screenshots, detailed issue description, and additional error screenshots or text if applicable.
  * _Screenshots_: Clearly labeled and anonymized.
* **Ineffective Troubleshooting Message**:
  * _Example:_ "I am getting an error popup 500 on some pages"
  * _Lacks_: One or more required screenshots, detailed error description.
  * _Result_: Inability to provide support due to incomplete information.

**Remember**: Providing complete and accurate information is the cornerstone of our support process. Your thoroughness enables us to help you swiftly and effectively!

## Reminder:

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### When setting up your Service Account, remember:

#### Administration Requirements

1. **Must be a Global Administrator while setting up the integration.** These permissions may be removed after the integration has been setup.
2. **Must be added to the AdminAgents group.** This group is required for connection to the Microsoft Partner API.

#### GDAP Group Requirements

1. **Recommended Roles:** When going through the invite process in CIPP, these groups will be automatically created. If you performed the migration with CIPP, these groups will start with `M365 GDAP`.
   1. **Note that these groups are not roles in your tenant;** they must be **GDAP-assigned groups.** For the latest details, refer to [recommended-roles.md](../../setup/installation/recommended-roles.md "mention")
2. **Don't over-assign GDAP roles.** Too many permissions will stop GDAP functionality.
   1. Review Microsoft's [GDAP frequently asked questions ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/gdap-faq)page for more information.

#### Multi-factor Authentication

1. **MFA Setup:** This account must have **Microsoft** MFA enforced for each logon.
   1. Use [Conditional Access](../../setup/installation/conditionalaccess.md) when available or via [Per User MFA](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/UserManagement/MultifactorVerification.aspx) when not available.
2. **Microsoft MFA is mandatory.** Do not use alternative providers like Duo, and ensure it's setup **before any login attempts.**
   1. Reference [this article on Supported MFA options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/security/partner-security-requirements-mandating-mfa#supported-mfa-options) from Microsoft for more details.
