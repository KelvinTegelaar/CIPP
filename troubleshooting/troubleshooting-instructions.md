# Troubleshooting instructions

<mark style="color:red;">**You must always supply all information requested in this document.**</mark>&#x20;

To ensure we can assist you with any CIPP issue, complete details are essential. This includes all three mandatory screenshots: Permissions Check, GDAP Check, and Tenant Access Check. Without these, we cannot offer support, as they are the foundation for understanding and resolving your issue.

**1. Perform Permissions Check**

* **How to**: Navigate to CIPP -> Settings, and select "Perform Permissions Check".
* **What to Share**: A screenshot of the results.

**2. Conduct GDAP Check**

* **After successfully completing Permissions Check**, proceed to the GDAP check.
* **What to Share**: A screenshot of the results.

**3. Run Tenant Access Check**

* **After a GDAP Check**, choose the relevant tenant and perform a Tenant Access check.
* **What to Share**: A screenshot of the results.

**If Errors Persist After Checks:**

* **Capture Additional Screenshots**: If checks complete but you're still facing issues, please include a screenshot of the entire page where the error occurs.
* **Error Details**: If an error pop-up appears, include its screenshot or text. This helps us diagnose the problem more accurately.

**Important**: Even if the error appears on only one page, all checks (Permissions, GDAP, and Tenant Access) are always required for us to provide support.

**Privacy Note**: Anonymize any sensitive data in your screenshots before sharing them on our discord community if you are planning to do so.

**Examples for Effective Communication:**
