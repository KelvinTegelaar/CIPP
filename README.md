# CIPP - CyberDrain Improved Partner Portal

CIPP is a management portal that allows Microsoft Partners to manage their customers. This project consists of two main repositories that work together:

1. **CIPP (Frontend)**: A Next.js web application that provides the user interface (this repository)
2. **CIPP-API (Backend)**: A PowerShell-based Azure Function App that handles API requests

This repository contains the frontend application. The current version is configured to deploy from the main branch.
