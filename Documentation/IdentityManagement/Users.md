# Groups

Using the users pages you can easily edit users and add users to groups or change their licenses, you can also create new users. There's also several quick buttons;

- Convert user to shared mailbox
- Disable user
- Reset user password

We have not made any confirmation pop-ups, so clicking makes the activity start.
# Current known issues / Limitations

Groups currently do not return all data such as external senders, and not all settings can be set by partners. Microsoft is aware and will fix this in a new release of the Graph API.
