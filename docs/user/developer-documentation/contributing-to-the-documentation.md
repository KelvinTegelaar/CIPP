> FOSS ([Free and Open-Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free\_and\_open-source\_software)) lives and dies by the contributions of their communities. Pages like this go unfinished because no one has been able to spare the time it takes to write something up for this. If you are reading this and have the time to contribute, please consider doing so! We have an edit button at the top of this page and others in order to make it easy for users to contribute. Simply click on the three-dot menu for additional options, including Edit.
