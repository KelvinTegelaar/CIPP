# Step 2: Implementing Drift Monitoring

After implementing the default baselines and running a single report, we can now check this tenant for how far they have drifted from our baseline.

This report will contain all the information on how the client deviates by category, listing the user impact. This report can be shared with the client or you can use this report to evaluate if implementation will not make massive changes and continue on.

Each item in drift monitoring shows you what the expected state is, and what we have found as the current state.&#x20;

Drift monitoring compares your tenant to the items configured in your standard **and** all Intune and Conditional Access Policies, this allows you to capture any policy that has been created outside of your baseline.&#x20;

## Handling deviations

Deviations can be present for multiple reasons; client wishes, client specific software. Let's explain how you can use CIPP to configure these different types of deviations.
