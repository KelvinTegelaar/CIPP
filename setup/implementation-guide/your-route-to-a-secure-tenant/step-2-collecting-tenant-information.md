# Step 2: Collecting Tenant Information

After implementing the default baselines and running a single report, we can now check each tenant for their drift settings, and we can retrieve the tenant change report.&#x20;

This report will contain all the information on the planned changed by catagory, listing the user impact. This report can be shared with the client or you can use this report to evaluate if implementation will not make massive changes and continue on.

### NOTE TO KELVIN: Finish this section with how to contact client, make recommendations, and agree on dates of implementation of each part of the report.&#x20;
