# Your route to a secure tenant

When using CIPP the primary purpose of most users is to find a route to secure tenant. CyberDrain offers assistance in reaching a more secure baseline for all your customers, including an impact analysis document, emails to sent to clients pre and post implementation, and ready made security baselines.

Follow this implementation guide to bring your tenants to a security level recommended by CIPP. Currently this security level aligns with multiple recognized standards such as CIS, Essentials 8, and Entra ID SCA. This guide is reevaluated every three months to keep up with the latest changes in M365.

This guide takes around 30 minutes to implement start to finish, where the end result is a secure tenant, with a change report for a client that shows the increase in Secure Score and next recommendations.
