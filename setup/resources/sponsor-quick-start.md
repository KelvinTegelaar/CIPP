# Sponsor Quick Start

{% hint style="success" %}
If you need assistance with or aren't comfortable navigating these requirements alone, take a look at our [Professional Onboarding Services](professional-onboarding-services.md) page, which offers a paid option for those who need a bit more hands on guidance with GDAP & CIPP deployment.
{% endhint %}

If you've started the sponsorship process and are ready to enhance your management of Microsoft 365 tenants with efficiency, this guide is designed to get you started.

## **Initial Sponsorship Actions**

1. **Subscription Activation**: Start by signing up for the $99 subscription using your GitHub account on the [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/KelvinTegelaar/sponsorships?tier_id=101398) page.
2. **Welcome Email**: Upon subscription, you will receive an email with detailed instructions to kickstart your deployment. This email will guide you to the [CIPP management portal ](https://management.cipp.app)for deployment steps.

## Deployment & Service Account Creation

3. **Configure CIPP Deployment:** Login to your [management portal](https://management.cipp.app) using the GitHub credentials you used to initiate the sponsorship. This is where you can kick off your deployment, add custom domain names, and begin inviting users into CIPP. <mark style="color:yellow;">NOTE: If you sponsor with an organization GitHub account, please send in a message to helpdesk@cyberdrain.com with your personal GitHub username so that we can manually add that user to the portal. You cannot log in to the management portal with organization accounts.</mark>
4. **Service Account Creation**: Follow the instructions carefully on the [creating-the-cipp-service-account-gdap-ready.md](../installation/creating-the-cipp-service-account-gdap-ready.md "mention")page to ensure there are no permission issues when connecting your tenants within CIPP in the subsequent steps.

## Accessing CIPP & Executing Setup Wizard

5. **Add Yourself to CIPP:** On the [User Management](https://management.cipp.app/invite-users) page in your management portal, ensure you've invited your work account as an `admin` into your newly deployed instance to avoid `403 Forbidden` errors during login. Further guidance can be found on the [roles.md](../installation/roles.md "mention") page.
6. **Execute Setup Wizard:** Follow the instructions on the [Executing the Setup Wizard](../installation/executing-the-setup-wizard.md) page once logged into your CIPP instance using your newly invited account, **NOT** the service account. The service account is only used during specific configuration steps within the Setup Wizard.

## **Managing Client Relationships**

7. **Onboard Existing Relationships:** If your GDAP relationships with clients are already configured and you do not need to create new invites, proceed to [adding-tenants-and-consenting-the-cipp-sam-application.md](../installation/adding-tenants-and-consenting-the-cipp-sam-application.md "mention") to start managing your clients immediately.
8. **Establish New Relationships:** If you need to establish new GDAP relationships for new clients, use the [gdap-invite-wizard.md](../installation/gdap-invite-wizard.md "mention") wizard to generate invites and complete the necessary actions to onboard the client to CIPP.

If you are unsure about whether your clients' environments are GDAP ready, or need more information about the process, continue to the [gdap-invite-wizard.md](../installation/gdap-invite-wizard.md "mention") page for more granular details & next steps.
