# Davis Powers CIPP Security Standards Templates

This repository contains a comprehensive set of security standards templates for use with the CIPP (Cloud Infrastructure Provisioning Platform) solution. These templates are designed to implement best-practice security controls across Microsoft 365 environments.

## Template Overview

All templates use the "dp" (Davis Powers) prefix and are organized by security domain:

### Core Security
- `dp_application_security.json`: Application and service principal controls
- `dp_identity_security.json`: Identity and authentication policies
- `dp_device_security.json`: Device registration and management

### Communication Security
- `dp_email_security.json`: Email protection and anti-spoofing
- `dp_teams_security.json`: Microsoft Teams security controls
- `dp_exchange_security.json`: Exchange Online security

### Data Protection
- `dp_dlp_security.json`: Data Loss Prevention policies
- `dp_sharepoint_security.json`: SharePoint security controls
- `dp_ediscovery_security.json`: eDiscovery and compliance

### Infrastructure Security
- `dp_dns_security.json`: DNS security including DMARC/SPF
- `dp_powershell_security.json`: PowerShell access controls
- `dp_linkedin_security.json`: LinkedIn integration security

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Access to CIPP admin portal
2. Global Administrator or Security Administrator role
3. Understanding of your organization's security requirements

### Installation Steps

1. **Prepare Templates**
   ```powershell
   # Create a directory for the templates
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "CIPPStandards"
   # Copy all template files
   Copy-Item "*.json" -Destination "CIPPStandards"
   ```

2. **Import into CIPP**
   - Navigate to CIPP Admin Portal
   - Go to "Standards Library"
   - Select "Import Standards"
   - Upload each .json file from the templates directory

3. **Review and Customize**
   - Review each standard's settings
   - Adjust impact levels if needed
   - Customize thresholds and values based on requirements

4. **Implementation Order**
   
   Recommended deployment sequence:
   1. Identity Security (MFA, Password Policies)
   2. Application Security
   3. Exchange and Email Security
   4. Device Security
   5. Teams and SharePoint Security
   6. DLP and Compliance
   7. Infrastructure Controls

### Usage Guidelines

1. **Testing**
   - Always test standards in a pilot group first
   - Use "Report Only" mode when available
   - Monitor for any business impact

2. **Monitoring**
   - Review compliance reports regularly
   - Monitor for policy violations
   - Track user feedback and adjust as needed

## Template Details

Each template includes:
- Clear naming convention (dp_*)
- Impact level indicators
- Compliance framework references
- PowerShell equivalents
- Default recommended values

## Security Levels

Templates use three impact levels:
- **High Impact** (Red): Critical security controls
- **Medium Impact** (Yellow): Important but less critical
- **Low Impact** (Blue): Recommended but optional

## Best Practices

1. **Phased Implementation**
   - Start with high-impact, low-risk changes
   - Gradually implement more complex policies
   - Communicate changes to users

2. **Documentation**

   - Record exceptions and reasons

3. **Compliance**
   - Map standards to compliance requirements
   - Regular compliance reporting
   - Maintain audit trails

## Support and Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Check for template updates quarterly
   - Review security baselines
