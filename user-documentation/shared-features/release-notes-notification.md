# Release Notes Notification

After a new update, when you first load CIPP you will have the release notes show up in a popup on your screen. You can even select prior releases to review. At the bottom you have three options

* View release notes on GitHub - takes you to GitHub to view the release notes
* Remind me next time - Will open again the next time you load CIPP
* Don't show untle next release - Will suppress the notification until CIPP gets a version update
