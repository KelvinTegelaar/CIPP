# Variable Auto Complete

When typing in text fields, you can now type `%` and begin typing the name of the variable you want to use in the text field. This will bring up a dropdown that you can use to auto complete variable names. This ensures you always type the variable name exactly how you input it into settings.

### Hotkey Support

Navigating the list is supported by the following hotkeys

| Hotkey       | Action                                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Arrow Down   | Scrolls down in the list                  |
| Arrow Up     | Scrolls up in the list                    |
| Tab or Enter | Accepts the selected variable in the list |
| Escape       | Closes the autocomplete list              |
