# CIPP Dashboard

The Home page provides a comprehensive overview of the current tenant's details and allows you to perform various actions related to the tenant and its resources.

The Home page includes the following sections:

* Universal Search: This is a universal search bar that allows you to quickly find the information you need using Lighthouse. To utilize this search, you must have onboarded Lighthouse on your partner tenant.
* Portals: Contains links to various Microsoft 365 administration centers.
* Executive Report: Create an Executive Report with key metrics to help guide your conversations with your clients around Microsoft tenant security and setup. These can be custom branded by going to [#branding-settings](cipp/settings/#branding-settings "mention"). Prior to generating the report download, you can review the report sections and toggle on or off the sections until you have your desired output.
* Current Tenant: Displays various details about the current tenant:
  * Tenant Name
  * Tenant ID
  * Default Domain
  * AD Sync Enabled
  * User Statistics: Total, Licensed, Guests and Global Admins. **Note:** The chart names are clickable.
