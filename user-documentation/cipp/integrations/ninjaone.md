# NinjaOne

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please Note the NinjaOne CIPP integration requires NinjaOne version 5.6 or above.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The NinjaOne integration provides several different options to give you control over what is synchronised from CIPP to NinjaOne.

Data is synchronized automatically once every 24 hours from Microsoft 365 / CIPP to NinjaOne.

The Intune Device Compliance Status utilizes Graph Webhook subscriptions and should update this field inside NinjaOne within minutes of a change occurring in Microsoft 365.

{% hint style="info" %}
For Tenant and Device information custom fields are used. For detailed Users and License information NinjaOne Documentation is used. If you do not currently have access to NinjaOne Documentation please reach out to your account manager.

The fields that you can configure are:

| Field Label                  | Type    | Definition Scope | Description                                                                                                                              |
