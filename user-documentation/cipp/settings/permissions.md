### Permissions Check

This section will display the results of a permission check. The checks are built to CIPP best practices to ensure proper application functioning.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you see that you are missing permissions, click the `Details` button. You will be presented with the option to repair any missing permissions.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The permissions check will also check if you have authenticated CIPP as a service account. This check is simply looking if `CIPP` or `service` are in the Display Name or User Principal Name of the account. If your service account does not match these but is still a service account, you can ignore this warning.
{% endhint %}

### GDAP Check

This section will display the results of a GDAP check. The checks are built to CIPP best practices to ensure proper application functioning. The `Details` button will display the additional information used to calculate the output of the check.

### Tenants Check

This table will display your existing GDAP relationships and useful information on their accessibility within CIPP. Reviewing this chart when you are having issues connecting to a tenant can help you identify any issues.
