# Time Settings

This page will allow you to modify certain time settings for how CIPP will operate.

## Timezone

This dropdown will allow you to set the time zone for CIPP operations and scheduling.

## Flex Consumption Business Hours

For those who are running CIPP on a flex consumption SKU in Azure, select the start of your business day from the drop down. CIPP will remain on higher availability for a 10-hour window from the time set. Outside of this window, CIPP may scale down to reduce costs.
