# Add Reusable Settings Template

This page will allow you to create reusable settings templates. Enter the template name and description and then set the Group Setting Collection (Policy):

* Autoresolve: If set to true, this will automatically resolve a domain, such as `reallybadphishingsite.com` to the IP address for the site
* Keyword: This is the domain or IP address that you wish to have included in the policy. Wildcard entries are allowed with the use of the `*` character
