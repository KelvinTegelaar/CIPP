# Tenant Onboarding

Onboarding tenants can be a challenge sometimes, especially when you haven't really taken care of your GDAP environments yet. \
We've made sure to ease this for you; Tenant onboarding now automatically adds missing groups, missing users, and it finishes everything for you. Use the onboarding wizard whenever you're adding a tenant to have a really good time. It removes all of the manual GDAP labour for you except accepting the invite.
