# Add Alert

{% hint style="info" %}
This same page will display for the edit alert action with the selected alert's information displayed to review, alter, and save.
{% endhint %}

CIPP offers a set of scheduled, recurring alert checks. Some of these duplicate Microsoft Alerts functionality in a more MSP-friendly manner and some are not available as a Microsoft Alert at this time. Similar to [standards](../../standards/ "mention"), you configure alerts using the wizard to select one or more tenants or -All Tenants- to apply alerts globally, then select from the list of available alerts.

### Alert Types

Within CIPP, there are two types of alerts:

* Audit Log Alert - These alerts are based on Microsoft audit logs.&#x20;
* Scripted CIPP Alert - These alerts have been developed by CIPP to pull from sources other than the audit logs.

### Alert Timing

* Audit Log Alerts - Processed in near real-time, but a small delay of up to 15 minutes is normal.
* Scripted CIPP Alerts - Each alert comes with a default value suggested by the CIPP team, but you can adjust it as needed. The available timings are:
  * 365 days / 1 year
  * 30 days / 1 month
  * 7 days / 1 week
  * 1 day
  * 4 hours
  * 1 hour
  * 30 minutes

### Alert Delivery Methods

* Webhook - This will deliver a JSON payload to the webhook configured in [notifications.md](../../../cipp/settings/notifications.md "mention").
* PSA - This will deliver a formatted payload to the configured PSA in [notifications.md](../../../cipp/settings/notifications.md "mention").
* Email - This will deliver an HTML-formatted table to the email address provided in [notifications.md](../../../cipp/settings/notifications.md "mention").&#x20;
