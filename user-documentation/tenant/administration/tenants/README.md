# Tenants

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you select one of the portal links, the permissions of the currently logged in user are the ones that matter. The user's GDAP permissions will apply, not the CIPP service account.
{% endhint %}

The Tenant page provides the ability for you to jump to the specific tenant administration centers for that client using your individual partner tenant user credentials. Allowing you to administer that specific tenant.

Tenants are cached for 24 hours. By using the Clear Tenant Cache button in [settings](../../../cipp/settings/ "mention"), you are able to reload the tenants from the partner center immediately. Remember to also clear your browser cache.
