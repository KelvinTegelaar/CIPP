# Edit Tenant

This page allows you to edit some basic information about a tenant. The following tabs have information that you can manage:

## General

### Tenant Details

This includes basic tenant details like the Display Name and Tenant ID pulled from your GDAP contract with the client.

### Properties

Here you can view/edit a custom alias for the tenant. This alias will currently only populate in the tenant dropdown in the menu bar. You can also manage the tenant's CIPP group membership.

## Custom Variables

This tab presents a way to manage [global-variables.md](global-variables.md "mention")on a per-tenant basis. For example, you need to set a client's RMM site ID.
