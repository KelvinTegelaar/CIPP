# CIPP Dashboard

Welcome to the CIPP Dashboard! This page provides you with both an overview of your client tenants and a powerful way to assess them. This page is laid out in a tabbed format with different important information on each tab.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The data CIPP uses to display the dashboard is cached in a database that gets updated at 3AM UTC each day. The first time you load the dashboard for a tenant, you will not see any data until the next refresh cycle occurs.
{% endhint %}

### Overview Tab

The overview tab serves two functions.

1. To provide information about your client tenant at a glance. Review the different information cards for helpful details about your client's tenant.
2. To control the new testing engine. Select a prebuilt report from the dropdown on the top right or create your own custom report to review your client's tenant against some of the more common frameworks. See the walkthrough for more details

### Identity Tab
