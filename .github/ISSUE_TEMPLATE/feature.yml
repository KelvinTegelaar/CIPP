      - Please search the existing feature request to see if there has been a similar issue filed.

      - Repeat feature requests are allowed if the previous request has been closed for more than 30 days
      
      - drive-by feature requests without effort will be closed.
      
      - A feature request has 14 days to be fullfilled before automatically being closed. if you want to work on the feature yourself use the phrase "I'd like to work on this please!"
      
      - Feature requests that are detrimental to security will also be closed without notice.
